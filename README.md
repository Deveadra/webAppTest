# Blog - Final Project 
for .NET - built from an empty framework.
For showcasing purposes, page viewing is locked behind sign-in. Default sign-in is user:admin - password:Password1
Registering as a new user shows role permissions and menu changes accordingly (cannot post, but can comment on posts created by admins, etc...)

# Backend:
-Adding database connections
-Identity Roles and Authentication services (basic users, power users, role managers, security admins)
